In this API you can perform CRUD operations for different routes such as users, customers, movies, and genres. <br><br>
There's a Json Web Token based authentication process and you can interact with some of these routes after creating an account.
Your passwords are encrypted and then salted to store them in the most secure way possible. <br><br>
There's also a role based authorization as well so only admin users can perform delete operations for particular routes. <br><br>
Exceptions and rejections are logged into files as well as the console so in case something goes wrong you will be provided with what you need to see. That's a relief! :)
