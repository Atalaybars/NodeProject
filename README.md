In this API you can perform CRUD operations for different routes such as users, customers, movies, and genres. <br>
There's a Json Web Token based authentication process and you can interact with some of these routes after creating and account. <br>
Your passwords are encrypted and then salted to store them in the most secure way possible. <br>
There's also a role based authorization as well so only admin users can perform delete operations for particular routes. <br>
